I myself have been a core user since the beginning, when I dropped my own project [react-native-node](https://github.com/staltz/react-native-node) in favor of Node.js Mobile.\\n\\nToday, I continue to see more and more developers choose Node.js Mobile for their tech stack. Some may call this a big hack, but the reality is that this toolkit allows unparalleled code sharing on various platforms. Since Electron also supports Node.js APIs, it is possible to have the same background JavaScript code running on MacOS, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS. If you also use the same frontend framework such as React Native (and React Native web), the same code sharing benefits apply there too. This is massive for developer productivity, whereas previously you had to use *five separate* native SDKs for each of these five platforms.\\n\\nAs the current maintainer of Node.js Mobile, I want to help keep this amazing project alive. As such, Autumn 2023 marks a reboot of Node.js Mobile, with the following four milestones:\\n\\n- [New docs website](https://nodejs-mobile.github.io)\\n- [New version v18.17.1 released](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs-mobile/discussions/52)\\n- [New official prebuild CLI](https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/prebuild-for-nodejs-mobile)\\n- [New donation system](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs-mobile/discussions/42)\\n\\nGoing forwards, there is a lot more we aspire to add, but the most important is keeping this project well-maintained, which means cleaning up outstanding bugs and crashes, taking security issues seriously and urgently, catching up with upstream Node.js and React Native, and closely matching our docs with our source code. These are the basics you can expect. For that, [donations](https://opencollective.com/nodejs-mobile) are vital fuel, so that\'s a great way how you can contribute too.\\n\\nOn the Cordova side, we are on the outlook for a maintainer to dedicate to [nodejs-mobile-cordova](https://github.com/nodejs-mobile/nodejs-mobile-cordova). If you are experienced in Cordova and believe you can maintain it, please [show up in this discussion](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs-mobile/discussions/14).\\n\\nThank you for co-investing in this tech stack, and together let\'s show the world how Node.js makes sense on mobile too!"}]}')}}]);
